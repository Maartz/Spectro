/// Core lazy relation type that wraps relationships to provide lazy loading functionality.
///
/// `SpectroLazyRelation` is the heart of Spectro's relationship loading system, providing
/// Ecto-inspired lazy loading with automatic N+1 query prevention. Relationships appear
/// as normal Swift properties but are lazy by default.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// This type wraps all relationship values and tracks their loading state, ensuring that
/// database queries are only executed when explicitly requested. This prevents the N+1
/// query problem common in ActiveRecord-style ORMs.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// You typically don't create `SpectroLazyRelation` instances directly. Instead, they're
/// created automatically by relationship property wrappers:
///
/// ```swift
/// public struct User: Schema {
///     @HasMany public var posts: [Post]  // Appears as [Post] but is lazy
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Access the lazy relation features through the projected value:
///
/// ```swift
/// switch user.$posts.loadState {
/// case .notLoaded:
///     // Load when needed
///     let posts = try await user.loadHasMany(Post.self, foreignKey: "userId", using: repo)
/// case .loaded(let posts):
///     // Use already loaded data
///     print("User has \(posts.count) posts")
/// default:
///     break
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Performance
///
/// - **Lazy by Default**: No queries executed until explicitly requested
/// - **Batch Loading**: Multiple relations can be loaded efficiently in batches
/// - **Caching**: Once loaded, the value is cached until the instance is deallocated
/// - **Memory Efficient**: Only loaded relationships consume memory
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// `SpectroLazyRelation` is fully `Sendable` and safe for concurrent access across actors.
/// All state changes are atomic and thread-safe.
